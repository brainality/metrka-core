# Public API

## Terminology

A **workspace** is the configuration and storage boundary for one related group
of data pipelines. It owns a definition root and a data root and contains one or
more configured streams. Portable workspaces keep both roots under one
transferable directory; managed workspaces may place them separately.

A **stream** is one configured data flow inside a workspace. A **dataset** is
the independently processed and published identity of that stream. Its
`dataset_id` combines the workspace and stream names as
`<workspace_name>.<stream_name>`; for example, workspace
`wi_dhs_adult_lead` and stream `county` form dataset
`wi_dhs_adult_lead.county`.

A **table** is one tabular output produced by a dataset. A dataset may produce
one or more tables, and each table may be materialized as one or more files or
publication assets.

Workspace operations initialize, locate, validate, import, export, and run the
whole configured workspace. Silver builds, publication candidates,
publications, and published assets belong to a specific dataset.

## Supported namespaces

The following namespaces are supported extension points for
metrka-datasets and other Metrka integrations:

- `metrka_core.api`
- `metrka_core.extensions.action`
- `metrka_core.extensions.acquisition`
- `metrka_core.extensions.source_schema`

Modules outside these namespaces are implementation details unless
explicitly documented otherwise.

Internal modules may move during refactoring. Public imports must remain
compatible within the declared package version range.

## Public symbol reference

Every name below is exported by `metrka_core.api`. The table is the canonical
symbol inventory for that module; removing or changing one of these contracts
requires the corresponding compatibility decision for the package version.

## Publication manifest access

Applications may combine the workspace resolver with the publication manifest
reader without importing Core storage implementations:

```python
from metrka_core.api import (
    RuntimeEnvironment,
    create_publication_manifest_reader,
    create_workspace_location_resolver,
)

location = create_workspace_location_resolver(
    runtime_environment=RuntimeEnvironment.PRODUCTION,
).resolve("gapminder")

reader = create_publication_manifest_reader(data_root=location.data_root)
# Read this value from catalog.dataset_publications.manifest_path.
manifest = reader.read_manifest(path=manifest_path)
```

The supplied path must be a canonical POSIX relative path below
`files/silver/manifests/`. Absolute paths, parent traversal, Windows drive
paths, backslashes, non-portable components, and symlink escapes are rejected.
The target must exist as a UTF-8 JSON file whose top-level value is an object.

Operational failures raise `PublicationManifestReadError`. Its `reason` is a
`PublicationManifestFailure`, so applications can distinguish missing files,
unsafe paths, storage escapes, read failures, invalid JSON, and non-object JSON
without parsing exception messages. Passing a non-`Path` data root remains a
programming error and raises `TypeError`.

## Quality check extensibility

Metrka Core 1.0 supports configuring the built-in quality checks through
workspace quality configuration.

Custom Python quality-check implementations and custom `QualityRegistry`
instances are not part of the public extension API in version 1.0.
`metrka_core.quality.registry` and its registration mechanisms remain internal
implementation details and may change without compatibility guarantees.

Public Gold-layer and custom quality-check extension points may be introduced in
a future release together with bootstrap, workspace-validation, and runtime
composition support. They are not part of the public API in version 1.0.

## External plugin licensing

The Apache-2.0 license of `metrka-core` applies to this repository and its
distributed packages. A separately developed and distributed plugin that uses
the documented extension protocols is an independent distribution and may be
governed by its own license terms.

External extensions must use a protocol explicitly documented in this file when
they need a stable compatibility boundary. Version 1.0 documents action,
acquisition, and source-schema extension protocols. Placing code in an external
package does not by itself make an internal `metrka_core` module public or stable.

## Pipeline execution

`run_pipeline()` is the supported high-level entry point for executing one
configured workspace:

```python
from metrka_core.api import run_pipeline

result = run_pipeline("wi_dhs_adult_lead")
print(result.pipeline_run_id)
```

`PipelineBootstrapOptions` holds optional infrastructure configuration for
programmatic callers. `open_pipeline_context()` and
`execute_configured_pipeline()` remain supported advanced entry points for
integrations that need direct control over composition and execution.

Full pipeline execution requires a reachable PostgreSQL metadata database
with the current Metrka metadata schema.

Quality gates are configured as part of the pipeline and executed by
`metrka-core`. The internal quality runner and registry are not independent
public execution APIs.


## Workspace initialization

`initialize_workspace()` is the supported programmatic entry point for creating
and registering a new local workspace:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from metrka_core.api import initialize_workspace

result = initialize_workspace(
    "example_dataset",
    download_url="https://example.org/data/example.csv",
    workspaces_config_path=Path("workspaces.local.yaml"),
    workspace_root=Path("workspaces/example_dataset"),
)
print(result.workspace_root)
print(result.definition_root)
print(result.data_root)
```

`WorkspaceInitializationResult` reports the placement, optional portable
workspace root, definition and data roots, registry, and configuration paths.
Pass `placement="managed"`, `definition_root`, and `data_root` to create a
detached managed workspace. Initialization never overwrites an existing
workspace or registration. The generated
configuration supports standard HTTP acquisition and Bronze ingestion only;
callers must add a real contract before enabling Silver processing.

Workspace registration is serialized per placement configuration file. The
read, conflict checks, filesystem commit, and atomic registry replacement run
under an adjacent interprocess `.lock` file, preventing concurrent `init` or
`import` commands from silently losing another workspace registration. The lock
file is operational state and may remain after the process releases the lock.


## Workspace validation

`validate_workspace()` is the supported read-only entry point for checking a
configured workspace before execution:

```python
from metrka_core.api import validate_workspace

result = validate_workspace("example_dataset")
print(result.pipeline_actions)
```

`WorkspaceValidationResult` reports the resolved configuration, streams,
actions, quality-check count, and validated Silver contract paths. Validation
does not connect to PostgreSQL, acquire data, execute actions, or write workspace
state. Integrations with custom actions or extractors may pass their composed
`PipelineRegistry` explicitly.


## Customer workspace export

`export_workspace()` reconstructs either a portable or managed workspace as one
portable ZIP package. Definitions keep their workspace-relative paths and the
configured data root is placed below `data/`, so the extracted directory has the
same physical contract as a portable workspace:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from metrka_core.api import export_workspace, import_workspace, verify_workspace_export

created = export_workspace(
    "example_dataset",
    Path("exports/example_dataset.zip"),
)
print(created.package_checksum)

verified = verify_workspace_export(created.package_path)
print(verified.file_count)

installed = import_workspace(
    created.package_path,
    destination_directory=Path("customer-workspaces"),
    workspaces_config_path=Path("workspaces.local.yaml"),
)
print(installed.workspace_root)
```

The package contains `metrka-workspace-manifest.json` below its single workspace
directory. The versioned manifest records the source placement, creation time,
canonical relative path, role, byte size, and SHA-256 checksum of every payload
file. It never records the source machine's absolute definition or data paths.

`definition_root` is a customer-visible product boundary: every retained file
below it is intended for the recipient. Deployment-only database configuration,
environment files, credentials, secrets, and private keys must live outside that
root. Export inspects structured definition files and fails before writing the
archive when it finds reserved metadata-database keys or a sensitive path. The
error lists every rejected portable path without exposing source-machine paths.

Export fails if a source root is unavailable, a linked file or directory is
encountered, a managed definition uses the reserved `data/` path, the destination
is inside either source root, or an existing destination would be overwritten
without explicit permission. An active Bronze or Silver execution marker
also blocks export so one package cannot silently combine two runtime states.
Operational Silver staging files are excluded. Version-control internals,
virtual environments, tool caches, and compiled Python cache files are also not
product content and are excluded. The archive is written atomically and verified
against its own manifest before it becomes visible at the destination.

`verify_workspace_export()` rejects malformed manifests, duplicate or unsafe ZIP
members, unrecorded or missing files, size changes, and checksum changes. It does
not extract the archive or connect to PostgreSQL. Successful results return the
checksum of the ZIP itself so it can be recorded or transmitted separately.

`import_workspace()` verifies the package, installs it below a new destination
directory, and registers the result as a portable workspace. The package's
workspace name determines the new directory and registry key. Existing roots and
registrations are never replaced. Extraction happens in a temporary directory;
the registry lock is acquired only for the final commit. The current registry is
then read again before installation, so a registration added during extraction is
preserved. If the registry cannot be written atomically, the newly installed root
is removed.

### Customer export error model

The two public export exceptions are separate `ValueError` subclasses because
they describe failures at different trust boundaries:

- `WorkspaceExportContentPolicyError` means export was stopped before a package
  was published because `definition_root` contains customer-visible content that
  is sensitive, deployment-only, or cannot be inspected safely. Its
  `violations` tuple contains `WorkspaceExportPolicyViolation` values with a
  portable `path` and human-readable `reason`. Integrations should consume these
  fields rather than parse the exception message; absolute source paths are not
  included.
- `WorkspaceExportIntegrityError` means a package manifest or ZIP failed
  structural, path-safety, membership, size, or checksum verification. It may be
  raised by `verify_workspace_export()`, by the verification phase of
  `export_workspace()`, or before `import_workspace()` writes the installed
  workspace.

Ordinary caller and filesystem errors continue to use standard exceptions such
as `ValueError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `FileExistsError`, and
`NotADirectoryError`. There is intentionally no broad catch-all Metrka export
exception: callers can distinguish a content-policy refusal from corrupted or
untrusted package evidence.


## Command-line execution

Installing `metrka-core` provides the stable `metrka` command. A configured
workspace using the standard core registry can be executed with:

```text
metrka run wi_dhs_adult_lead
```

`python -m metrka_core run wi_dhs_adult_lead` is equivalent. Connection secrets
are intentionally not accepted as command-line arguments; use
`METRKA_METADATA_DSN` or a protected metadata configuration file instead.

The stable command for creating a Bronze-ready workspace is:

```text
metrka workspace init example_dataset --download-url https://example.org/data.csv --workspace-root workspaces/example_dataset
```

Portable initialization requires `--workspace-root`. Managed initialization
requires `--placement managed`, `--definition-root`, and `--data-root`. The
command selects its placement file through `--workspaces-config-path`,
`METRKA_WORKSPACES_CONFIG_PATH`, or `workspaces.local.yaml` in development.
The same precedence and production safeguards apply when calling
`initialize_workspace()` directly.

Validate a workspace without executing it or requiring PostgreSQL:

```text
metrka workspace validate example_dataset
```

Create and independently verify a portable customer package:

```text
metrka workspace export example_dataset --output exports/example_dataset.zip
metrka workspace verify-export exports/example_dataset.zip
metrka workspace import exports/example_dataset.zip --destination-directory customer-workspaces
```

Use `--overwrite` only when replacement of an existing package is intentional.
The output path must be outside both configured workspace roots.
Import selects its registry through `--workspaces-config-path`,
`METRKA_WORKSPACES_CONFIG_PATH`, or `workspaces.local.yaml` and always creates a
portable placement below the supplied destination directory.
Production initialization and import require an explicit path or
`METRKA_WORKSPACES_CONFIG_PATH`; they never create a registry in the process
working directory implicitly. The same rule applies to CLI and Python API calls.

The CLI uses the standard core registry. Dataset packages that provide custom
actions or extractors compose their registry explicitly and call
`metrka_core.api.run_pipeline()` from their own entrypoint.


## Operator commands

The installed `metrka operations` command is the supported interface for
metadata administration and Silver governance workflows:

```text
metrka operations metadata check
metrka operations engine-releases list
metrka operations publication-candidates list --dataset-id example.county
metrka operations reconcile-publications --workspace example --dataset-id example.county
```

Run `metrka operations --help` or the nested command's `--help` for the full
options. Commands that change the metadata schema or governance decisions use
the privileged connection selected by `METRKA_MIGRATION_DSN`. Read-only
commands use the normal metadata connection configuration.

The command paths above are stable. Their implementation modules remain
internal and may move; external automation must not invoke
`metrka_core.pipeline.silver.manage_*` directly.


## Workspace locations

Applications that only need to locate workspace roots can call
`create_workspace_location_resolver()`. The factory returns the public
`WorkspaceLocationResolver` protocol and keeps the standard YAML adapter an
internal implementation detail. It applies the same explicit-path,
environment-variable, development fallback, and production safeguards as
pipeline execution.

`open_pipeline_context()` accepts either `workspaces_config_path` or a custom
`WorkspaceLocationResolver`. A resolver returns a `WorkspaceLocation` with a
read-oriented `definition_root` and an independently writable `data_root`.
Production runs must pass the path explicitly or set
`METRKA_WORKSPACES_CONFIG_PATH`. Development runs may use `workspaces.local.yaml`
from the current working directory.

The standard YAML adapter requires every workspace to declare one of two
placements. A portable entry declares `workspace_root` and resolves:

```text
<workspace_root>/
├── conf/                  definition_root
└── data/                  data_root
```

A managed entry declares `definition_root` and `data_root`, which may live in
different repositories, disks, mounts, or volumes. Relative paths are resolved
from the placement file. Unknown fields, incomplete placement entries, reused
roots, and missing directories fail before pipeline composition. A custom
resolver remains supported. Pipeline composition treats both placements
identically: code provenance is collected from `definition_root`; mutable
artifacts and integrity-relative paths are owned by `data_root`.

Dataset configuration belongs to the running application. `metrka-core`
never discovers it by walking upward from the installed package directory.

The resolved `definition_root` must be contained in a Git repository. Its
repository identity is collected directly from Git; `data_root` does not need
to be version controlled, and no installed distribution named
`metrka-datasets` is required. A root `pyproject.toml` may provide an optional
project name and version, but a configuration-only repository is supported.

An installed `metrka-core` wheel uses immutable provenance embedded at build
time rather than treating an enclosing consumer repository as the core source
checkout. Missing or inconsistent embedded provenance fails closed.


## Acquisition lifecycle

Acquisition is a mandatory platform-owned lifecycle phase that runs once
before configured pipeline actions.

Extensions may register custom `AssetExtractor` implementations. Capture
management, landing storage, receipts, and the standard `AcquisitionDeps`
remain owned and composed by `metrka-core`.

Extractor-specific collaborators, such as HTTP clients or provider SDKs,
should be injected into the registered extractor implementation rather than
added to `PipelineContext` or the standard `AcquisitionDeps`.
